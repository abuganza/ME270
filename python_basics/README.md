## Python basics 

This [Python notebook](PythonBasics) contains some of the basics of programming in Python. However, it is by no means a comprehensive effort. If you are interested in learning Python more in depth please check out other tutorials, like (this one)[python.org]. 

To run Python you need a Python interpreter, i.e. a software that can read and execute python code. You don't necessarily need to install anything in your computer. If you do, then I recommend downloading the [Anaconda Python distribution](anaconda). Once you have download and installed it, you can run the Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupyter notebook. This repository has several iPython notebooks which can be openend and run with Jupyter. Check out this [video](youtube). 

If you don't want to install Python in your computer, then you have other options. If you are a Purdue student then you can run Jupyter on the cloud through [Nanohub](nanohub). Check out the [video](youtube). One more option is to use [Google Colab](colab). You can check a video of how to do that [here](youtube).
